HTML Semantics
	What comes to mind when one hears the acronym 'HTML'? I can imagine its usually programming or coding or whatever name one can use to define it. Well, as the name implies, html is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language used to describe the contents of web pages basically. The Hypertext defines the link between the pages and markup language. its main file in any project is usually "index.html".
	For any beginner who wants to know what it takes to create a website has the option of using html which is browser friendly. Almost all websites worldwide were created using HTML as the bedrock framework, a few examples include: social media blogs, e-commerce websites, portfolio websites and so much more.
	When we hear the word 'semantics' in html it simply means the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather that just presentation. It makes the page more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layers of web pages. its core characteristic is to clearly communicate its content to both the developer and the browser. Its structure is in the format:
1	header: defines the header for a web page.
2.	nav: defines a container for navigation links.
3.	section: defines a section in a web page.
4.	article: This element contains the main part, containing information about the web page.
5.	aside: holds the content aside of the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
6.	footer: defines the footer for a document or a section.
7.	details: it specifies the tag for additional details.
8.	main: this specifies the main page content and should be unique.
9.	summary: this specifies a header for the 'details' element.
10.	mark: this specifies the text that is highlighted.
